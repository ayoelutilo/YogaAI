### Hey there! Welcome (Namaste) to yogAI, developed in 2022 by Divyata Gosai.

I created YogaAI inspired by various Machine Learning models for visual recognition for 
    my <a href="https://nexus.uwinnipeg.ca/d2l/home/42287" target="_blank">course (The Philosophy of Yoga)</a> as my creative project assignment .
    This is my first project with Machine Learning model and attempt at Web Development. 
    <br><br>
    This is my first attempt to make an AI-powered yoga assistant. This is a virtual yoga trainer.
    It monitors your posture using Tensorflow during various yoga poses, and tells if you are doing it correctly or not.
    It has a button to learn so, first we can learn yoga poses within 10 seconds.
    After learning, we start doing practice poses within 30 seconds.
    There is another button about Philosophy of Yoga, it is a short description of it.
    where you can find words to click that are links to various websites, wikipedia and youtube videos.
    Feel free to watch and read <a href="https://divinelight2002.github.io/YogaAI/philoYoga.html" target="_blank">about Philosophy of Yoga</a>, it will         give you better understanding and knowledge.<br>
    <br>YogaAI uses <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/models/pose_estimation/overview" target="_blank">Pose.Net</a>, developed by Googleâ€™s TensorFlow, and <a href="https://ml5js.org/" target="_blank">ml5.js</a>,
    a JavaScript library for Machine Learning on the browser. Most of my learning was following <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6YPSwT06y_AEYTqIwbeam3y" target="_blank">
    The Coding Trainâ€™s</a> YouTube playlist on Pose Estimation. <br>
